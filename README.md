## üîπ Overview
## Deep Common Variant Analysis Tool for Risk Assessment. Decode your genome profile, assess disease risk, protect and proactive health with DeepCV!

The **DeepCV Alpha Version** is a computational workflow for **variant annotation and genetic risk scoring using statistical methods and LLM-Powered multiomics risk scoring system for each gene**
*This pipeline has been tested using **synthetic data generated orgnal form from `NA12878.ann.vcf.gz`** and **GWAS catalog database**.


### ‚úÖ Purpose  
- Computes **genetic risk scores** for **each gene associated with a disease**.  
- Provides **a filterable gene list** for disease-specific risk analysis.

## üìÇ DeepCV Workflow - Files & Descriptions

### **üìå How the Data is Used in DeepCV**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **The user provides a VCF file** (`.vcf` or `.vcf.gz`) as input.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **DeepCV extracts relevant SNPs and mutations**, removing non-informative variants.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Annotation is performed** using clinical databases and functional impact predictors.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk scores are computed**, generating a list of **genes associated with disease risk**.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Results are stored in structured output files**, such as `final_risk_assessment.csv`.  

Below is an overview of the **DeepCV workflow** and the corresponding scripts.

# DeepCV Alpha - Genetic Risk Scoring Workflow  
The workflow has 4 main steps: vcf processing and filtring, anntionon, risk score assment, and risk graph constriction. The repostir provide code form step 1 to 3. 
in the follong disted of each step and how it wwill be exuted using DeepCV : To run **DeepCV Alpha**, use the following command:

# **DeepCV: Command Guide & Usage Instructions üöÄ**

DeepCV is a bioinformatics pipeline that processes **VCF files**, performs **SNP annotation**, and conducts **genetic risk assessment**.

This guide provides a **step-by-step catalog** of all DeepCV commands.

---

##Setting Up DeepCV (First-Time Users)
Ensure dependencies are installed before running DeepCV:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or create a Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate DeepCV
```

 

#  Example Workflows
## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Full Pipeline**
To run **all steps** (VCF processing, SNP annotation, and risk assessment) in one command:

```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --input_vcf input.vcf --output_path "deepcv_results.csv"
```
üîπ Full Pipeline with Single Disease
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --input_vcf sample.vcf --output_path "diabetes_risk.csv" --disease_name "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"
```

This command will:
- Process input.vcf
- Annotate SNPs using Ensembl VEP API
- Perform genetic risk scoring
-Save results to deepcv_results.csv

üîπ Annotate & Assess Multiple Diseases
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --skip_step1 --disease_name "Cardiovascular Disease Hypertension"

```
üîπ Only Compute Risk Scores for Annotated Data
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --skip_step1 --skip_step2 --output_path "risk_assessment.csv"

```


## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Execution
üîπ Step 1: Process & Filter VCF File
Run only the VCF processing & filtering step:

```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --input_vcf input.vcf --skip_step2 --skip_step3
```
‚úÖ This will:
- Extract variant information from `input.vcf`
- Filter SNPs based on quality score & depth
- Save processed variants to: `results/processed_variants.csv`

üîπ Step 2: Annotate SNPs
If you already have a processed VCF file and want to run only SNP annotation:
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --skip_step1 --skip_step3
```
‚úÖ This will:
Annotate variants with ClinVar, dbSNP, and GWAS Catalog
Save annotated results to: `results/final_annotated_output.csv`

üîπ Step 3: Perform Genetic Risk Assessment
If you have an annotated file and only want to compute genetic risk scores:
```batch
python DeepCV_Main.py --skip_step1 --skip_step2
```
‚úÖ This will:
- Use Open Targets API to find disease associations
- Compute risk scores for genes
- Save results to: `results/final_risk_assessment.csv`

``

3Ô∏è‚É£ Specifying Disease for Risk Assessment
By default, DeepCV analyzes all disease associations, but you can filter for specific diseases.

üî∏ Single Disease Analysis
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --input_vcf input.vcf --disease_name "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"
```
‚úÖ This will: Only keep genes related to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the final output.

üî∏ Multiple Disease Analysis
To analyze multiple diseases, use space-separated disease names inside quotes:
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py --disease_name "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension"

```
4Ô∏è‚É£ Output Files & Directories
DeepCV saves all results inside the results/ directory:

After execution, DeepCV generates several files:

| **Filename**                   | **Description**                                             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `final_annotated_output.csv`   | Annotated SNPs with functional & clinical significance     |
| `final_risk_assessment.csv`    | Computed genetic risk scores for all genes                 |
| `filtered_by_disease.csv`      | Disease-specific filtered results                          |
| `filtered_by_disease_cleaned.csv` | Duplicate-removed version of `filtered_by_disease.csv`  |

## üîπ DeepCV Alpha Workflow Steps  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Input Processing Filtering:**  (**`DeepCV_Main.py`** ) **`step1_processing.py`** extracts relevant variants from **VCF files**.
   - Reads **VEP-annotated VCF files**.  
   - Extracts **genomic variants** and their **functional impact**.

```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py input.vcf
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Variant Annotation**    **`step2_SNP_annotation.py`** adds **functional & clinical annotations**.  
   - Integrates **GWAS catalog mutations**.  
   - Assigns **clinical significance scores** to each variant.  
   - Computes **weighted genetic risk scores** for each gene.

```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py input.vcf --output_path "deepcv_results.csv"
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Calculation:**  **`step3_risk_assessment.py`** computes **risk scores** based on **gene-disease associations**.  
   - Produces a **list of genes with associated risk scores**.  
   - Allows **filtering genes** based on disease-specific associations.
  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The final risk assessment results are saved in **CSV files** for further analysis.

## üîπ Filtering Genes by Disease  

To filter the **genetic risk scores** based on a specific disease, use:
```bash
python DeepCV_Main.py input.vcf --disease_name "Your Disease Name"

```
